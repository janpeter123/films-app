## Purpose of this App
At the college our team had to develop a Netflix Like app for Desktop and Mobile, I ended up with my own version of the same app.

## What's the difference between them?
My app has some features focused on User experience, I have created it from scratch focusing on Technologies like React with Chakra ui and React Router Dom.

## How to run it locally
 run `npm i` inside the folder of this app to install all the dependencies needed.
 run `npm start` to run the app. It should open a browser window to ` localhost:3000 `
